description: Enable or disable language learning mode
---

Turn language learning mode ON or OFF. When enabled, Claude will speak acknowledgments and completions in BOTH your main language and target language.

Usage:

```
/agent-vibes:learn              # Turn ON
/agent-vibes:learn off          # Turn OFF
/agent-vibes:learn status       # Show current setup
```

## How Learning Mode Works:

When learning mode is **ON**:

1. **First**: Speak in your main language (using your current voice)
2. **Then**: Speak the SAME message translated to your target language (using target voice)

Example:

```
Main language (English, Aria): "I'll check that for you"
Target language (Spanish, Antoni): "Lo verificar√© para ti"
```

## Setup Steps:

1. Set your main language:

   ```
   /agent-vibes:language english
   ```

2. Set your target language:

   ```
   /agent-vibes:target spanish
   ```

3. Set target voice (recommended):

   ```
   /agent-vibes:target-voice Antoni
   ```

4. Enable learning mode:

   ```
   /agent-vibes:learn
   ```

5. Check your setup:
   ```
   /agent-vibes:learn status
   ```

## Notes:

- Translations are **direct translations** of what was said in the main language
- Same **personality/sentiment** applies to both languages
- Works with all AgentVibes features (BMAD, personalities, etc.)
- Requires multilingual voices for target language (Antoni, Rachel, Domi, Bella, etc.)
- Small pause (0.5s) between main and target language announcements

## Disable Learning Mode:

```
/agent-vibes:learn off
```

This returns to normal single-language TTS mode.
