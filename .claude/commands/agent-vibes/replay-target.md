description: Replay the last target language audio (for language learning mode)
---

Replay the last message that was spoken in your target language during language learning mode.

This is useful when learning a new language - you can hear the translation again without triggering a new one.

Usage:

- `/agent-vibes:replay-target` - Replay the last target language audio

**Note:** This only works when language learning mode is active (`/agent-vibes:learn`).

!bash .claude/hooks/replay-target-audio.sh
