# Agent Vibes - Role-Based AI Agents

Activate a specialized AI agent with a specific professional role and expertise. Unlike personalities (which change speaking style), agents embody complete professional roles with domain-specific knowledge, methodologies, and coaching frameworks.

## Available Agents

**Inspired by**: [Chris Voss](https://www.blackswanltd.com/) - Former FBI hostage negotiator

### `/agent-vibes:agent health-coach`

## How Agents Work

1. **Slash Command**: Type `/agent-vibes:agent <name>` to activate an agent
2. **Agent Context**: The AI loads the agent's complete professional framework
3. **Specialized Guidance**: You receive expert coaching in that domain
4. **Persistent Session**: The agent role continues until you deactivate it

## Example Usage

```bash
# Activate negotiator for salary discussion
/agent-vibes:agent negotiator
"I need help negotiating my salary offer..."

# Switch to health coach for wellness goals
/agent-vibes:agent health-coach
"I want to lose weight and improve my energy..."

# Get motivated to overcome procrastination
/agent-vibes:agent motivator
"I keep putting off starting my business..."
```

## Agent vs Personality

| Feature      | Agents                                  | Personalities                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**  | Professional role with domain expertise | Speaking style and tone        |
| **Content**  | Structured frameworks and methodologies | Emotional flavor and character |
| **Depth**    | Deep domain knowledge and coaching      | Surface-level style changes    |
| **Examples** | Negotiator, Health Coach, Motivator     | Sarcastic, Flirty, Pirate      |
| **Use Case** | Solve specific problems                 | Make interactions entertaining |

You can combine both! For example:

- `/agent-vibes:agent negotiator` + `/agent-vibes:personality professional`
- `/agent-vibes:agent motivator` + `/agent-vibes:personality intense`

## Deactivating an Agent

Simply start a new conversation or explicitly state: "Exit agent mode" or "Return to normal mode"
